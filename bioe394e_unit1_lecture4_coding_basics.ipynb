The ```__init__``` method is similar to a constructor method if you are familiar with other programming languages. The initialization method takes ```name```, ```number```, and ```position``` as arguments when a ```BasketballPlayer``` instance is created. ```self``` is a reference to the object itself. Providing ```self``` as an argument to a method gives this method access to the different attributes and methods of the object.\n"
